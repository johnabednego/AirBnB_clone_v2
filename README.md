# 0x03. AirBnB clone - Deploy static

This project involves deploying the web_static work of an AirBnB clone using Fabric for Python3. The primary objectives of this project are to familiarize oneself with CI/CD, the AirBnB clone concept, and basic concepts related to deployment and Nginx configuration.

## Concepts
For this project, understanding the following concepts is essential:
- CI/CD
- AirBnB clone

## Background Context
In this initial deployment project, the objective is to deploy the web_static work. Fabric, a Python library and command-line tool, will be used for streamlining SSH use for deployment or system administration tasks.

Before starting, fork the repository `AirBnB_clone_v2` from your partner if you donâ€™t have it.
